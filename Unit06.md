title: "ENVS504: Society, Economy, and the Environment"
course_description: "This course will use a complex systems theory perspective to investigate how coupled human-environment systems interact to either increase or decrease their risk of collapse. This complex systems approach works across many disciplines, so that human-environment linkages can be understood from sociological, environmental science, and economic viewpoints."

**Unit 6: Invasive Species, Globalization, and Trade** <span
id="6"></span> 
*With the era of industrialization and fossil fuel use, humans have been
able to move themselves, their cargo, and some unwanted stowaways much
farther and faster than was possible historically.  Organisms such as
zebra mussels, cane toads, and mountain pine beetles may be too small to
do much damage individually, but as their populations explode in new
areas, they have taken over ecosystems with dire consequences for the
societies that depend upon them. * *Migration of humans from one society
to another has had both positive and negative social and environmental
effects, as has the trade in the goods and services they produce.  The
movement of cargo ships, trucks, and airplanes has created a wave of new
organisms to new areas, increasing the risk of invasive species and the
disruptions they can cause.*  
  
 *This unit will review the flows of humans, species, and resources
across the planet.  This unit will explain how these flows are creating
threats, stresses, and consequences that substantially decrease the
resilience of many societies.*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Define and discuss terms such as: biotic homogenization, exotic,
    globalization, and invasive.
-   Discuss the rates of increase of movement of humans, species, and
    traded goods across the planet, and state the increasing distances
    over which these movements have taken place during the past 200
    years.
-   Identify a variety of social and environmental impacts that a
    globalized workforce and trading system have incurred, both positive
    and negative.
-   Construct the routes of loss of resilience in local societies due to
    outbreaks of invasive species (e.g., from ecosystems to natural
    capital to human communities).

    materials.  You may have to register a free account by clicking the
    “register” link at the top of the page to download these files.  The
    materials will be downloaded into a zipped folder on your hard
    drive, so you will need to extract the files to see them (you may be
    able to right click on the folder icon and follow the extraction
    instructions).  The files include a synthesis report, a Power Point
    presentation, and an Exercise file.  The report provides a great
    deal of information on the life history characteristics that
    successful invasive species possess and the types of ecological
    communities that are the most vulnerable to invasion.  The report
    also provides a description of the specific kinds of disturbances
    that invasive species create in ecosystems, along with their
    economic costs to local communities.  The presentation describes the
    main points of the report.  The exercise instructs you to examine
    your local habitats and ecosystems for invasive species, prompting
    you to collect data and conduct a basic analysis.  Of course, there
    are no “correct” answers, because each student will be conducting
    the survey in a different place, so you may find the exercise
    interesting but of limited use.  However, this exercise might be a
    good starting point for a discussion of invasive species in the
    Saylor Foundation’s [discussion
    forums](http://forums.saylor.org/).  
      
     Reading these materials and taking notes should take approximately
