Human societies have always been dependent upon local and regional
environments for critical natural resources, and loss of these resources
(either due to environmental changes or human overuse) has often reduced
a society’s resilience to future challenges.  When resilience decreases,
the risk of societal collapse increases.  Today, our globalized, highly
connected societies have increased access to environmental resources,
yet they leave us more vulnerable to disruptions and disasters that
begin in other regions or systems.  By understanding how our societies
are connected to each other and to the environment, we can better manage
our interactions so that they do not increase the potential for societal
collapse.  This course will use a complex systems theory perspective to
investigate how coupled human-environment systems interact to either
increase or decrease their risk of collapse.  This complex systems
approach works across many disciplines, so that human-environment
linkages can be understood from sociological, environmental science, and
economic viewpoints. The course will begin with a primer of complex
systems theory and then will discuss the theory’s influence on the
science of societal collapse.  Then, the course will review trends and
issues in a variety of systems and society-environment interactions that
are critical to most communities, including strained energy and food
resources, loss of biodiversity and cultural resources, risks posed by
invasive species and international trade, impacts of overpopulation and
excess consumption, and alteration of flows of key resources.  The final
“Solutions and Syntheses” unit will allow you to apply your knowledge to
several discussions of current societies and their vulnerabilities.  You
will be able to identify the human and environmental connections that
are at risk of failing (and therefore at risk for societal collapse).
 The goal of the course is to help you become literate in the terms and
concepts relating to societal collapse and resilience, environmental
issues, and societal responses to them. This course is cross-listed as
an elective in two curriculums: a) Environmental Sciences and b)
Science, Technology, & Society curricula.  For Environmental Sciences
majors, this course will demonstrate how human activities can rearrange
ecosystems, alter flows of nutrients and species, and bring about what
some geologists are now calling the Anthropocene Epoch, a period of time
dominated by human activities.  For Science, Technology, & Society
majors, the course will help strengthen the application of a
multidisciplinary approach to problem-solving and risk assessment that
includes social and economic perspectives.  The basic goal of this
course is to provide you with the necessary theoretical foundation
(complex systems and societal collapse theories) to allow you to
identify critical interactions between social and environmental systems
that govern systemic risk of collapse.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

-   Connect the impacts of some environmental systems on other
    environmental systems, e.g., energy resources and climate change on
    biodiversity loss, pollution, and altered flows of resources.
-   Identify multiple society-environment connections as drivers of
    potential societal collapse.
-   Identify the environmental pressures that a particular society faces
    and potential solutions to ease these pressures and increase the
    society’s resilience.
-   Analyze and debate proposed solutions to environmental issues or
    sustainable development plans.
-   Integrate multiple society-environment issues into a complex
    narrative, explaining whether the society is expected to have great
    or little resilience to these issues and how the society might
    increase its resilience to changes in climate, resource
    availability, and globalization trends.

### Course Information

Welcome to ENVS504.  General information on this course and its
requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer: **Audrey L. Mayer, Ph.D.  
    
 **Primary Resources: **The materials for this course are a collection
of free, online materials from a wide variety of sources.  However, the
course makes primary use of the following materials:  

-   The University of Illinois: Tom Theis and Jonathan Tomkin (eds.)’s
    [*Sustainability: A Comprehensive
    Foundation*](http://www.earth.illinois.edu/sustain/documents/col11325-1.38.pdf)
-   Millennium Ecosystem Assessment’s[*Ecosystem and Human Well-Being:
    Biodiversity Synthesis*](http://www.maweb.org/en/index.aspx)
-   Millennium Ecosystem Assessment’s [*Current State and Trends
    Assessment*](http://www.maweb.org/en/Condition.aspx)
-   Yale University: Professor Kelly Brownell’s [The Psychology,
    Biology, and Politics of Food
    Lectures](http://oyc.yale.edu/psychology/psyc-123#sessions)
-   University of Oxford: Professor David Coleman’s [Demographic Trends
    and Problems of the Modern
    World](http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/demographic-trends-and-problems-modern-world)
-   The American Natural History Museum’s [Modules and Resources for the
    Network of Conservation Educators &
    Practitioners](http://ncep.amnh.org/index.php?globalnav=resources&sectionnav=main)(you
    must register to access these materials, but registration is free)

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of the materials associated
with it.  While it is not absolutely necessary to work through the units
in order, it is highly advised that you begin with Units 1 and 2 and
leave Unit 9 for last, as this unit assumes the mastery of the subjects
from the previous 8 units.  You will also need to complete:  

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the materials in each unit.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
**134.75hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. 
These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to
take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set
goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 8.5 hours. 
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
subunit 1.1 (a total of 3.75 hours) on Monday night; subunits 1.2 and
1.3 (a total of 4.75 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.
