title: "ENVS504: Society, Economy, and the Environment"
course_description: "This course will use a complex systems theory perspective to investigate how coupled human-environment systems interact to either increase or decrease their risk of collapse. This complex systems approach works across many disciplines, so that human-environment linkages can be understood from sociological, environmental science, and economic viewpoints."

**Unit 4: Food Systems** <span id="4"></span> 
*Aside from water, food is one of the most basic and important resources
for all species, humans included.  As human societies have transitioned
from hunter-gatherers or nomadic livestock herders to sedentary
agriculturalists, the impacts on their societal and environmental
systems have changed as well.  Intense debates currently surround the
sustainability of any of these systems in general and the different
approaches to agriculture in particular.  While the Green Revolution
used fossil fuels, chemicals, and genetically modified organisms to
greatly boost yields of foodstuffs in industrial fields, the social and
environmental consequences of this revolution are beginning to become
apparent.*  
  
 *This unit will cover the impacts of these food production transitions
on social and environmental systems as well as their implications for
societal resilience versus collapse.  Materials will compare resilience
in both historical case studies and contemporary ones and will briefly
examine the Slow Food, organic, and locavore movements as potential
solutions to the negative impacts of industrial agriculture.*

     Instructions: Please click on the above link and read this article,
    which discusses the case of livestock herding in Mongolia and its
    recent negative impacts on the environment (particularly the
    grasslands).  Much of this degradation occurred after the collapse
    of Soviet rule, when the traditional communal management practices
    were replaced with a privatized structure which led to overgrazing.
     These governance changes occurred in tandem with negative impacts
    from climate change.  Now, local leaders are diversifying local
    economies and reinstating a communal management structure to try to
    preserve the productivity of the grasslands and the sustainability
    of the herding culture.

    lecture.  You may also download and following along with the
    transcript for this lecture.  Professor Brownell discusses Thomas
    Malthus’ early predictions that populations will always outstrip
    their food supplies (leading to famine and population reductions). 
    In this lecture, he also addresses how the Green Revolution has
    forestalled Malthusian predictions but also created a lot of
    environmental damage in its wake.  The Green Revolution was a series
    of inventions and methods developed after World War II that
    dramatically increased agricultural productivity, including the use
    of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and genetic
    modifications to crop seeds.

    and PPT)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the above link and download all of
    the materials.  You may have to register a free account by clicking
    the “register” link at the top of the page to download these files. 
    The materials will be downloaded into a zipped folder on your hard
    drive, so you will need to extract the files to see them (you may be
    able to right click on the folder icon and follow the extraction
    instructions).  Materials in the folder include two Word files (a
    Synthesis report, and Exercises) and a Power Point presentation that
    provides a review of the main points of the report.  The report
    reviews the resources and services that agricultural systems require
    from diverse ecosystems, and then describes the many negative
    impacts that traditional and modern agriculture can have on
    ecosystems.  The report also briefly describes modifications that
    can be made to agricultural techniques and crops that can make the
    practice more sustainable.  The “Exercises” document provides a
    sample scenario for you to apply changes to techniques and crops to
    achieve sustainable agriculture.  Discussion questions will guide
    your learning, and although answers are not provided, these would be
    good questions to pursue in the Saylor Foundation’s [discussion
    forums](http://forums.saylor.org/).  
      
     Reading these materials, taking notes, and completing the exercises
    should take approximately 2 hours.
