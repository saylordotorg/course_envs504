title: "ENVS504: Society, Economy, and the Environment"
course_description: "This course will use a complex systems theory perspective to investigate how coupled human-environment systems interact to either increase or decrease their risk of collapse. This complex systems approach works across many disciplines, so that human-environment linkages can be understood from sociological, environmental science, and economic viewpoints."

**Unit 3: Anthropogenic Climate Change and Energy Resources** <span
id="3"></span> 
*Although in the past, climate change has been linked to volcanic
activity, meteor collisions, and other natural phenomena, the changes
occurring now are for the first time closely linked to human activities,
in particular the use of fossil fuels as an energy source and land use
change.  The transition from fossil fuels to renewable fuels (such as
solar, wind, and biomass) will not only help human societies shift their
reliance from exhaustible to renewable sources (an important task in the
face of peak oil, or reaching the maximum production of oil after which
production declines), but these renewable sources are also either carbon
neutral or have zero carbon emissions.*  *Transitions from fossil fuels
to renewable fuels have a cost, however, as land previously dedicated to
natural habitats and agriculture will need to be converted to biomass
production (or flooded) for energy generation.  These land use changes
also impact carbon sequestration and albedo, two key factors in climate
change.  For these reasons, current climate change and energy use are
linked by the same human activities.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will briefly review the science behind climate
change as well as renewable and nonrenewable energy resources.  You will
then learn about the interconnection between climate change and energy
resources.  This interconnection makes solutions for both problems
difficult, particularly in the long term.*

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Differentiate between renewable and nonrenewable energy sources.
-   Recognize the production signature of a nonrenewable resource (e.g.,
    peak oil).
-   Explain why fossil fuels are more disruptive to climate conditions
    than renewable energy sources.
-   Explain why land use change can contribute positively and negatively
    to both climate change and energy resources.
-   Briefly describe how human energy use has altered the carbon balance
    between the biosphere and the atmosphere, driving climate change.
-   Explain how the switch to carbon-neutral or carbon-free energy
    sources will help avoid severe climate change and mitigate energy
    shortages.
