title: "ENVS504: Society, Economy, and the Environment"
course_description: "This course will use a complex systems theory perspective to investigate how coupled human-environment systems interact to either increase or decrease their risk of collapse. This complex systems approach works across many disciplines, so that human-environment linkages can be understood from sociological, environmental science, and economic viewpoints."

**Unit 7: Carrying Capacity: Overpopulation and Consumption** <span
id="7"></span> 
*In late 2011, the global human population exceeded 7 billion people;
this was just 12 years after the population had reached 6 billion
people.  The current rate of population increase is exponential, which
means that it takes less time to add each additional billion.  While
there is some debate as to whether growth in population is ultimately a
problem, it is undeniable that more people will require more food,
water, space, and other resources, leaving fewer resources for other
species and ecosystems.  At the same time, economic development in many
countries has rapidly increased the per person consumption of resources,
leading to additional strains on the environment and passionate
discussions regarding fairness across nations and cultures.*  *Indeed,
the argument that dissuaded the United States from ratifying the Kyoto
Protocol was over whether total carbon emissions (which would have
favored the United States) versus per capita carbon emissions (which
would have favored China and India) should have been the metric of
compliance.*  *The debate over “total” versus “per capita” underlies
many of the resource struggles at global and regional scales.*  
  
 *This unit will explain carrying capacity as well as several of its
measurements, such as the Ecological Footprint index and the I=PAT
equation.  The index measures the sustainability of a specific level of
resource consumption and illustrates the consequences of population
versus consumption on natural resources.  The unit will conclude with a
discussion of policies aimed at slowing population growth (which have
largely succeeded) and reducing consumption (which have mostly failed).*

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Define and discuss terms and concepts such as: carrying capacity,
    ecological footprint, forest transition, per capita, and the rebound
    effect.
-   Outline a timeline for human population growth and consumption rates
    of important resources (such as oil, forests, precious metals,
    etc.).
-   Describe policies that have been successful at reducing population
    growth and why they work.
-   Describe policies that have attempted to curb consumption and the
    most likely reasons for their failures.

     Instructions: Please click on the above link and watch this
    lecture.  You may also click on the link above to download and
    follow along with the transcript.  This lecture describes what
    demographers call a “demographic transition,” where a population
    shifts from rapidly growing with a large proportion of youth (under
    30 years old) to a stable (or declining) population with equal
    numbers of people in the middle-aged and elderly age brackets.
     Professor Wyman describes how these transitions occurred in
    European countries, and then he contrasts them to how populations
    are or might transition in developing countries.  He attributes
    these differences primarily to cultural views on birth control and
    women’s empowerment.
