**Unit 10: Synthesis and Solutions** <span id="10"></span> 
*Each of the systems discussed in previous units is important in its own
right.  The problems that societies must try to solve within those
systems are very challenging.  However, these systems interact with each
other, and the weakening or collapse of one system (e.g., loss of
coastal wetlands and the flood protection they provide) can lead to a
catastrophe in another system (e.g., massive flooding of New Orleans and
other coastal cities by a category 3 Hurricane Katrina).*  
  
 *In this unit, you will read articles and watch short videos that
discuss many of these issues and their interconnections.  This unit will
synthesize concepts from previous units.  This final unit is meant to
give you a more holistic understanding of these issues and how they
influence each other and human societies.  The resources in this unit
will provide examples of how these issues can be woven into a cohesive
narrative of the current problems we face and how we might solve them.*

     Shipley and her coauthors describe how combined heat and power
    systems (often called “cogeneration”) can greatly enhance the
    efficiency of many types of energy systems, but particularly those
    in power plants and industrial and commercial buildings.  This
    method of energy generation also reduces the greenhouse gas
    emissions by kilowatt of energy.

     Paul Robbins uses the example of wildlife populations in a reserve
    in India to argue that traditional nature reserves (which isolate
    plant and animal populations within strictly protected areas, away
    from human presence) may not be the most ideal or feasible approach
    to biodiversity conservation.  He describes the importance of
    considering land use and human activities as well as the day-to-day
    decisions of local land managers, when identifying the more
    effective conservation approaches.
