**Unit 8: Alteration of Flows of Resources** <span id="8"></span> 
*Prior to the Industrial Revolution and fossil fuel-based
transportation, the flow of key nutrients such as nitrogen and
phosphorus, metals, and other resources was slow and fairly
local.*  *Oceanic trade routes transported precious metals such as
silver and gold, but most other material flows were primarily governed
by climatic and abiotic processes.*  *In the past 200 years, human
activities (e.g., trade, transportation, and industrialization) have
greatly increased the speed and area over which many resources are
transported and used, often ending up in areas of very high
concentration that damage environmental systems.  For example, the
massive excess of nitrogen and phosphorus used as fertilizers in
agricultural systems in the Midwestern United States wash off of these
fields and into local waterways, eventually ending up in the Gulf of
Mexico by way of the Mississippi River.*  *These nutrients cause massive
algal blooms, which sink to the bottom of the body of water and
decompose when they die off.  The decaying biological matter creates a
massive area of hypoxia (lack of oxygen), also called a “dead zone,”
because the hypoxia prevents most other organisms from surviving in
these waters.  Dead zones negatively impact fisheries and are a growing
problem around the world, especially with negative impacts on local
communities which depend upon ocean ecosystems for protein resources
(e.g., fish, shellfish, etc.) but do not have the financial ability to
ship in these foods from less damaged areas.  Many of these altered
resource flows terminate in growing piles of discarded materials that
are difficult to recycle or reuse.  For many resources, societies have
converted cyclic flows to linear flows from the extraction of fossil
fuels or virgin source to landfills or ocean pollution.*  
  
 *This unit will cover how these altered flows result from and affect
activities discussed in previous units.  This unit will also address how
these altered flows affect the resilience of societies.*

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Identify abiotic agricultural resources that are causing ecosystem
    disruptions due to increased flow cycles.
-   Identify other abiotic resources that are currently facing a peak in
    production (that is, a long term reduction is indicated) and the
    products and services that will decline as a result of their
    exhaustion.
-   Identify where the major sources of these abiotic resources exist
    and why social and economic relationships (positive or negative) can
    obstruct trade in these resources.
-   Identify and describe cascading shortages of goods and services that
    are likely as these abiotic resources become scarce.
-   Discuss the social and environmental causes and impacts of the
    increasing number and size of landfills.

    States and urges land managers to shift their focus on increasing
    the amount of carbon stored in soil (instead of solely focusing on
    soil loss).  As you learned in previous resources, soil is a major
    sink for carbon, and several carbon mitigation policies emphasize
    the use of techniques that sequester carbon in soils.
