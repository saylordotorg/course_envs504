**Unit 5: Loss of Biodiversity, Cultural Diversity, and Ecosystem
Functions** <span id="5"></span> 
*Biodiversity (the number and abundance of different species of
organisms) is known to be positively related to ecosystem productivity
and perhaps to stability and resilience to disturbances and invasive
species.  Recent research has found that cultural and linguistic
diversity closely follows spatial patterns of biodiversity, suggesting
that human diversity is dependent upon diverse ecosystems.  The
extinction rates of both biodiversity and cultural diversity are
substantially above background rates, and it is likely that our planet
will become substantially simplified before these rates return to
normal.  Globally, we are likely to lose many goods and services
provided by ecosystems (such as food, fiber, energy production, water
purification, and other goods and services that can be thought of as the
natural capital of societies).  We will also lose the knowledge of how
to use these goods and services effectively and sustainably as local
cultures disappear.*  
  
 *This unit will provide a basic overview of the causes of extinction of
biological and cultural diversity.  This unit will explain the linkages
between biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and natural resources
required by human societies.*

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Define and discuss terms and concepts such as: ecosystem goods and
    services, ecosystem productivity and stability, habitat, mass
    extinction.
-   Identify the major drivers of both ecological and linguistic
    destruction.
-   Predict areas of high biodiversity loss when given information on
    patterns of language loss, and vice versa.
-   Infer losses of different kinds of natural and social capital from
    the loss of particular ecosystems (e.g., wetlands, forests, etc.)
-   Relate loss of natural and social capital to decreased resilience of
    human-environment systems.
