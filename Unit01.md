title: "ENVS504: Society, Economy, and the Environment"
course_description: "This course will use a complex systems theory perspective to investigate how coupled human-environment systems interact to either increase or decrease their risk of collapse. This complex systems approach works across many disciplines, so that human-environment linkages can be understood from sociological, environmental science, and economic viewpoints."

**Unit 1: Introduction to Complex Systems Theory** <span id="1"></span> 
*Many of the crises and catastrophes that human societies have faced
have seemed catastrophic, because humans typically assume that systems
are simple and change in gradual, linear ways.  Instead, most systems
are actually complex, and nonlinear relationships and changes are far
more common.  Many scientific disciplines now use complex systems theory
to better understand dynamic systems (those that undergo change
constantly).  Complex systems theory, or the study of systems that are
characterized by nonlinear changes over time, has been especially
important to the study of coupled society-environment systems.  This
theory has provided a foundation for the resilience concept for
ecosystems and the development, maturity, collapse, and reorganization
of coupled society-environment systems.*  
  
 *This unit will provide you with a basic background in complex systems
theory, including definitions for common terminology, descriptions of
the underlying system behaviors, and how this approach allows for system
prediction and measurement, including the measurement of risk of
catastrophe or collapse.*

    that are driven by individual behavior.  He also explains the
