title: "ENVS504: Society, Economy, and the Environment"
course_description: "This course will use a complex systems theory perspective to investigate how coupled human-environment systems interact to either increase or decrease their risk of collapse. This complex systems approach works across many disciplines, so that human-environment linkages can be understood from sociological, environmental science, and economic viewpoints."

**Unit 2: Societal Collapse** <span id="2"></span> 
*In 1988, the anthropologist Dr. Joseph Tainter published his book,* The
Collapse of Complex Societies*, which described de-evolution of ancient
societies, such as the Maya, Chaco, and Roman empires, in the presence
of climate change and resource depletion.  Dr. Tainter realized that the
response of these societies to these environmental challenges was to
increase societal complexity, establishing a positive feedback between
complexity and resource consumption that ultimately led to the society’s
demise.  In 2004, Dr. Jared Diamond’s book,* Collapse: How Societies
Choose to Succeed or Fail*, furthered this line of inquiry, identifying
historical and modern-day cases in which societal responses to
environmental pressures either increased their resilience by adapting
the society to operate within new environmental limits, or decreased
their resilience by further degrading the environment and resource base.
 These two works spawned a large field of research into societal
resilience and collapse, for which complex systems theory has been a
very helpful framework.  State failure (the collapse of governments in
modern nation-states) is the current-day counterpart to the societal
collapse literature.  While studies of past societal collapses can give
us insight into the large-scale drivers of collapse, case studies of
currently failed states provide much richer detail as to how central
governments lose control over their territory, and how difficult it can
be to pull a society out of a failed state.  From this small-scale
perspective, state collapse is often the consequence of a collection of
poorly made decisions by leaders; this observation was also made by both
Tainter and Diamond working at a larger scale as a society’s response to
stresses.  For some scholars, a failed state is the last step before a
society completely collapses.*  
  
 *This unit will familiarize you with the terminology and concepts in
the societal collapse research area.  This unit will demonstrate how
this work helps to inform current decision-makers at local, regional,
and global scales about ways to increase the resilience of their
societies.*

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Define and discuss terms and concepts of the societal collapse
    literature, including: adaptation and mitigation, collapse, failed
    state, reorganization, and stress.
-   Classify societal responses to environmental issues as likely to
    increase or decrease resilience.
-   Explain how small-scale dynamics or choices can aggregate into
    large-scale problems.
-   Analyze examples of past societies that have collapsed, the main
    drivers of these collapses, and the behaviors of the societies that
    conspired to accelerate the collapse (e.g., non-adaptive behaviors).
-   Identify current societies that may be at risk of collapse, and
    identify the main stresses placing these societies at risk and
    societal behaviors that are either increasing or decreasing this
    risk.

    Diamond’s TED Talk.  In this lecture, he describes the five main
    factors of collapse of human societies and provides examples from

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this short
    news article about causes of state failure in countries in Africa.
     In particular, the “resource curse” is a risk factor for state
    failure that is cited in many studies.  You should note that the
    types of resources that increase risk are those that cannot be
    easily used by local communities (such as water or forests), but
    rather those that can fetch a high price from rich countries (e.g.,
    diamonds and other minerals) and provide cash to purchase weapons.

     Instructions: Please click on the above link and read the material
    below the video box before watching the interviews.  The charts
    describe the results of the yearly Failed States Index study
    conducted by the Fund for Peace.  The methodology that the
    organization uses has been accused of having a Western bias, as
    Western and developed countries are consistently ranked more highly
    than other nations.  Then, click on the play button for the video,
    and watch the interviews with JJ Messner, Elliot Ross, and Syed
    Mohammad Ali.  The interviewees provide different opinions on the
    utility of failed states discussions in general and the Fund for
    Peace’s index in particular.  
      
     Reading this material and watching the interview should take
    approximately 45 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the above link and watch this
    lecture.  Professor Freedman uses the more neutral term of
    “transformation” than collapse or failure to describe the end of the
    Roman Empire.  He pursues different explanations for the
    transformation and whether it was sudden enough to put the Roman
    Empire in the same category of other catastrophic societal
    failures.

    stresses such as regional drought and internal factors such as a
    lack of adaptive capacity.

     Instructions: Please click on the above link and read the entire
    article.  On Easter Island (“Rapa Nui,” as it is known by its
    inhabitants), the causes of the disappearance of the people
    responsible for the striking stone statues (or “moai”) scattered
    around the island has always been shrouded in mystery.  Hunt (an
    anthropologist) argues that most of the popular beliefs surrounding
    what happened to the society are likely mostly or totally incorrect.
     Instead, he suggests that an explosion of invasive rats may have
    led to the rapid devegetation of the island and loss of this
    critical resource for the human population.
