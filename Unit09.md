**Unit 9: Systems Thinking: Understanding Sustainability** <span
id="9"></span> 
*This unit focuses on material from the Open University’s* [*“Systems
Thinking: Understanding
Sustainability”*](http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=4331)*course*.
 *The short readings and activities in the unit are an excellent primer
on sustainability and sustainable development (and the difference
between the two).  Both are inherently interdisciplinary topics, where
interactions between social, environmental, and economic dimensions can
complicate understanding system problems and finding solutions to them.
 So far in this course, we have addressed single systems (e.g., energy,
food, etc.), but the ways in which these systems interact in multiple
dimensions is more clearly addressed here.*
